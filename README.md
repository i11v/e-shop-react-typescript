# E-shop

## About

You are provided with an e-shop app that displays product categories and the products themselves. Of course, it was not designed very well, so there are some bugs here and there.

## Data

Data is taken from public API:

```
https://dummyjson.com/docs/products
```

## ToDo

There is a list of faced issues and possible improvements:

[] - When the user selects more than one category, only the products of the last selected one are displayed. All selected categories should be tackled;
[] - User can select same category multiple times;
[] - It isn't possible to deselect a category.

Next steps:

[] - App needs to be extended with the support of sub-categories.
Example: category "laptops" can have sub-categories: "gaming","professional", "ultrabooks", "home"
[] - Design the contract. How API should looks like.
What new structure of FE components would be?

Let's have some fun!

P.S. Don't forget about tests
